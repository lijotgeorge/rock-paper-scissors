## Challenges
This project required me to have to rethink/relearn a lot things I thought I knew about DOM manipulation using JS. Having taken a look at the existing projects in the TOP showcase I knew that what I wanted to do was different. The only thing was figuring out how to do something I had not seen done before. 

Setting up the initial layout of the UI was not that hard. I had the image of what I wanted it to look like in my head and translating it to the webpage using HTML/CSS was straightforward. It was how to make stuff work using buttons and JS and all that other stuff that took the majority of time. I needed some help from the Discord server for this as well. They cleared up some confusion I had regarding the functioning of JS vis-a-vis the DOM and also suggested alternatives to when it was not possible to do what I wanted to do in JS. All in all a great experience! Would recommend.

I'm still not completely sure about my choices in the fonts and background though. I didn't like it to be completely blank and wanted to go for a Street Fighter-esque aesthetic but I'm not sure I was successful in that respect. But it is what it is.

I might visit this project again to tweak the look maybe but I'm happy with the backend stuff for now.
